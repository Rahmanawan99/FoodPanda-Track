# FoodPanda-Track
We can extract our FoodPanda order history into a tabular format for further analysis

Make sure to download all Emails from foodpanda as an .eml file (Forward all emails to an email and download as attachment)
Emails are with the subject: "Your Order has been placed"

Save the emails in a folder and call them on the jupyter file
